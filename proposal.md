#Project Proposal

1. Objectives
  * Social platform with no barrier to entry
  * Ability to discover new potential hobbies and activities
  * Meet other users interested in pursuing similar interests
2. Research
  * Most people consider only one or two of their main interests to be "hobbies"
  * Time is the biggest hurdle when considering a new hobby. Money is a close second
  * Meeting new people is more appealing if previously aware that you have a common mindset or hobby
  * Other social planning applications like Meetup are difficult to use to get into a new hobby
  * Free time is most commonly spent in front of a form of media (TV, youtube, social media, etc.)
  * Time of year and weather play large role when deciding what to do with free time
3. Target Audience
  * Ages approx 18-35
  * Located in a somewhat densely populated area (cities, metropolitan areas, suburbs, etc.)
  * Uses some form of social media
4. Prioritized Features (a "+++" denotes an optional feature)
  * On demand activity reccommendations
  * Interaction with other users who have shown interest in the same activity
  * Categorized activities (visisble to user, sortable) and activity tags (back end, used for relevance)
  * Basic account integration OR social media login (most likely facebook)
  * Ability to create events hosted on remote server (+++)
  * Recommendations become more relevant as user selects more events (+++)
  * Can function without access to location data (+++)
5. Differentiators
  * Meetup requires a specific type of hobby or idea before making plans
  * Competing features in other applications are nearly impossible to create plans on-the-fly with
6. Constraints
  * Limited number of users will make it difficult to get the most out of the functionality
  * Resources prevent more robust server-side functionality, especially account storage and recommendations
  * Less visisble types of activities that aren't widely known will be difficult to identify and include

## Categories of Activties
### Gaming
 * Access to video games via [Internet Game Database](https://market.mashape.com/igdbcom/internet-game-database/overview)
 * Searchable by specific name or genre, starting a new chat will create a new channel in order to display any games that users have shown interest in

### Conversational
 * Set categories for different types of conversational activities (category names are working titles)
 * Each category provides a conversation option (in-person and digital)
 * Categories initially will be: Philosophy, Literature, International Events, Modern Innovation, and General Debate

### Unique Tastes
 * For types of cuisine or "hidden gem" dining experiences
 * Displays based on current location or custom location
 * Yelp API to obtain information on actual restaurants
 * A few explicit categories may be added for cooking purposes, TBD

### Theatrical Experiences
 * Anything from a newly released movie to an off-Broadway play to a Broadway musical with tickets starting at $5,000,000

 * Ticketmaster API for non-movie events
