**Would you consider yourself a puzzler (one who enjoys solving puzzles)?**

Yeah, I guess you could say that. I mean I like solving puzzles... But I'm not like obsessive.

**What kind of puzzles do you like to solve?**

Well, my favorite is Portal 2. A lot of fun hours trying to solve those... But I can just as easily play 2048 or something.

**Have you ever done a sudoku puzzle?**

Yeah, they're cool. I remember when I finally figured out how I'm supposed to do them. I used to think there was all this math involved.

**Do you play multiplayer games?**

I do. Some playstation stuff... Words with friends... but I also like to get lost in a lot of single player games. I don't know, sometimes you meet some real jerks online. But I guess that doesn't really happen with something like Words with Friends.

**What is exciting about a multiplayer game?**

I think... yeah, strategy. I mean that's the whole point, right? Unless you're playing on the same team as someone, you're trying to beat them.
