**Would you consider yourself a puzzler (one who enjoys solving puzzles)?**

For sure. I even make my own crossword puzzles.

**What kind of puzzles do you like to solve?**

Crosswords, mostly. But I'm known to jump into any type of brain teaser, really.

**Have you ever done a sudoku puzzle?**

Yeah, it's been a while though.

**Do you play multiplayer games?**

I play a lot of board games. But if you talking more video games, no.

**What is exciting about a multiplayer game?**

The competition. Always a good feeling to out-wit the guy across from you. And if you throw a few dollars on the line that certainly makes things a little more fun.
