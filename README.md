## Overview

**XB Media & Market App**
This app is a simple, easy to use app that gives gamers the things that they need right upfront.  The thing that puts this app apart from other apps is that you can download the game clips and screenshots from Xbox live directly onto your phone, no other app gives you that option..even the actual Xbox Smartglass App. This app also gives gamers the information they need to get the full potential out of their Xbox Live Membership by showing the Free games and games on sale specifically for Gold Members.

**Tech/Libraries**, 
In this app I mainly used Async Tasks to do all the API calls to xboxapi.com.  I also used the Facebook SDK to have a sharing feature, and used an android library found from Android Arsenal (fm.jiecao:jiecaovideoplayer:5.1) to make the fullscreen video player with swipe commands for volume change and time scrubbing. For downloading, I just used the native DownloadManager to queue up and download clips/screenshots
